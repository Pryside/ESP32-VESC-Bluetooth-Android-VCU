# ESP32-VESC-Bluetooth-Android-VCU
Arduino ESP32 Vehicle Control Unit, that controls a VESC and sends its data over Bluetooth to an Android App

This is the Hardware Firmware for the eScooter Project
This Firmware can control a VESC, get its data, and send it to an Android phone.
It also controls a WS2812B led strip that is synced to the wheelspeed.
